# Welcome to my first *Official* TypeScript Project

This is my first official TypeScript Project. I'm working from scratch just to get familiar with the syntax. It'll be a basic single-page application displaying minimal information and requiring minimal interaction from the user.

## Running the Application Locally
Note: The following assumes that you have cloned the repository to your local machine as well as have the following installed:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/)

### Initialize Typescript
```
tsc --init
```

### Compile Typescript
```
tsc
```

Note: If ```compilerOptions``` are not configured correctly under ```tsconfig.json```, you will need to run the following command instead:
```
tsc index.ts
```

## Notes
View [Notes](/Notes.md) for configuration examples and additional project notes.

P.S. Also contains the general TS notes I'm taking as I build this project.
